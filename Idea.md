# OTT User Engagement & Retention Analysis – Project Idea

---

## 1. Project Idea Overview

The **OTT User Engagement & Retention Analysis** project aims to study how users interact with OTT platforms over time and identify behavioral patterns that influence long-term retention. The project focuses on understanding **what keeps users engaged**, **why users churn**, and **how content and subscription strategies impact repeat usage**.

This project is designed as a **descriptive and diagnostic analytics study**, avoiding machine learning and predictive modeling. The goal is to transform raw OTT usage data into meaningful business insights using **Excel, SQL, Python (EDA only), and Power BI**.

---

## 2. Motivation Behind the Project

OTT platforms face intense competition, where acquiring users is expensive and retaining them is critical for profitability. Many platforms struggle to answer questions such as:
- Why do users stop watching content?
- Which content drives repeat engagement?
- How does engagement differ across subscription plans?

This project was conceived to address these challenges by creating a **data-driven engagement and retention framework** that helps stakeholders make informed decisions.

## 3. Problem Statement

OTT platforms generate massive volumes of user activity data, but this data is often underutilized. Without structured analysis, it becomes difficult to:
- Measure true user engagement
- Track retention trends
- Identify early signs of churn

There is a need for a centralized analytics approach that converts viewing and subscription data into **actionable insights**.

---

## 4. Project Goals

- Understand user engagement behavior across content types
- Measure user retention and repeat usage patterns
- Analyze the relationship between content consumption and subscription duration
- Provide visual insights through interactive dashboards
- Support business decision-making with data-backed recommendations

## 5. Key Questions the Project Aims to Answer

- How frequently do users return to the platform?
- What is the average watch time per user?
- Which genres and content types drive higher engagement?
- How does engagement differ between retained and churned users?
- At what stage do users typically disengage?
